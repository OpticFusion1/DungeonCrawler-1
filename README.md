# DungeonCrawler
A basic java game with text input 
------------------------------------
Plans:
* Add a map style area for town
* Add a randomly generated dungeon (size)
* Navigate via arrow keys or ** n/e/s/w inputs (TBD)**
* randomly generated stats? ** for chosen class? (TBD) **
* randomly generated enemies (based on dungeon level? or PC level?)
* equipment shop (maybe not rng)
* cash rewards from chests? / gear / bosses
* each dungeon floor has a boss encounter
