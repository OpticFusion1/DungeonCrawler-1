# DungeonCrawler
A basic java game with text input 
------------------------------------
## Plans:
* Add a map style area for town
* Add a randomly generated dungeon (size)
* Navigate via arrow keys or **n/e/s/w inputs (TBD)**
* randomly generated stats? **for chosen class? (TBD)**
* randomly generated enemies (based on dungeon level? or PC level?)
* equipment shop (maybe not rng)
* cash rewards from chests? / gear / bosses
* each dungeon floor has a boss encounter
* level up - can choose 3 stats?


	Example stats
| STR 	| 5 	|
| DEX 	| 5 	|
| AGI 	| 5 	|
| INT 	| 5 	|
| WIS 	| 5 	|
| END 	| 5 	|
| CHA 	| 5 	|
| LUCK 	| 5 	|

## Instructions:
To launch the game on Windows, simply double click the DungeonCrawler.jar.

The game has not yet been tested on other operating systems.

## Dependencies:
Uses [lanterna](https://github.com/mabe02/lanterna) 3.0.0-beta3 for UI.

On Windows and other graphical operating systems, this uses a JFrame wrapper
terminal for the game.
